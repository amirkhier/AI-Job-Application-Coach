# Salary Negotiation Guide

## Research and Preparation

### Market Research
- Use Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, PayScale, Blind, and LinkedIn Salary Insights.
- Research compensation for your specific role, level, location, and industry.
- Factor in total compensation: base salary, bonus, equity/RSUs, signing bonus, benefits.
- Understand how company stage affects pay: startups often offer more equity but less cash.
- Ask recruiters directly: "Can you share the compensation range for this role?"

### Know Your Worth
- Document your top 5 quantified achievements from the past 2–3 years.
- List unique skills, certifications, or domain expertise you bring.
- Calculate your current total compensation (including equity, bonuses, and benefits).
- Determine your walk-away number — the minimum you'll accept.
- Prepare a target range: your ideal number and your realistic floor.

## Negotiation Strategy

### Timing is Everything
- Never discuss compensation in the first interview.
- Wait for the employer to make the first offer when possible.
- The best leverage is after they've decided they want you — post-offer.
- Give yourself at least 48 hours to consider any offer.
- If pressed early, say: "I'd love to learn more about the role before discussing compensation."

### What to Negotiate Beyond Base Salary
1. **Signing bonus** — especially valuable if you're forfeiting unvested equity.
2. **Equity / RSUs** — understand vesting schedules (typically 4-year with 1-year cliff).
3. **Annual bonus target** — ask for the target percentage and historical payout rate.
4. **Paid time off** — additional vacation days or flexible PTO policy.
5. **Remote work / flexibility** — hybrid schedule, relocation assistance, home-office stipend.
6. **Professional development** — conference budget, training allowance, tuition reimbursement.
7. **Title** — a higher title may accelerate your next career move.
8. **Start date** — negotiate time between jobs for rest or travel.
9. **Performance review timeline** — ask for a 6-month review instead of 12 to accelerate raises.

### Negotiation Tactics
- Start with genuine enthusiasm: "I'm really excited about this opportunity."
- Present your case factually: "Based on my research and the scope of the role, I was expecting compensation in the range of $X–$Y."
- Use competing offers as leverage, but do so respectfully — never bluff.
- If they can't move on salary, pivot: "Is there flexibility on signing bonus or equity?"
- Always negotiate one thing at a time. Don't overwhelm with a list of demands.
- Be collaborative, not adversarial: "How can we make this work for both of us?"

## Scripts and Phrases

### Expressing Gratitude
"Thank you so much for the offer — I'm genuinely excited about this role and the team. I'd like to take a couple of days to review the details."

### Asking for More
"I'm very enthusiastic about joining. Based on my research and the value I expect to bring, I was hoping for a base salary closer to $X. Is there room to move in that direction?"

### When They Push Back
"I understand there are constraints. Would it be possible to revisit compensation at the 6-month mark, or adjust other components like equity or signing bonus?"

### Accepting
"I'm happy to accept. Could you send the updated offer letter so I can confirm the details in writing?"

## Common Mistakes

1. **Accepting immediately** — Even if the offer is great, take 24–48 hours. Rushing signals you undervalue yourself.
2. **Focusing only on salary** — Total compensation, growth opportunity, and work-life balance matter just as much.
3. **Apologising for negotiating** — This is a normal business conversation. Be confident and professional.
4. **Making ultimatums** — "I need $X or I walk" rarely works. Collaborative framing is far more effective.
5. **Not getting it in writing** — Verbal promises aren't binding. Always request a written offer letter with all agreed terms.
6. **Negotiating after accepting** — Once you say yes, the negotiation is over. Do all your negotiating before you sign.

## Special Situations

### Startup Offers
- Equity can be worth far more than cash — or worth nothing. Assess company stage and trajectory.
- Ask about dilution, liquidation preferences, and exercise window.
- Request the company's most recent 409A valuation.
- Cash compensation may be 10–30% below market, offset by equity upside.

### Career Changes
- You may need to accept a temporary pay cut to enter a new field.
- Negotiate for accelerated review cycles and a clear promotion path.
- Emphasise transferable skills and the fresh perspective you bring.
- Consider contract-to-hire arrangements to prove your value quickly.

### Counter-offers from Current Employer
- Counter-offers address the symptom (money), not the root cause (growth, culture, challenge).
- Statistically, most people who accept counter-offers leave within 12 months anyway.
- If you decide to stay, get the counter-offer in writing with a clear timeline.
