# Resume Writing Best Practices

## Resume Structure and Format

### Essential Sections
1. **Contact Information**
   - Full name, phone number, professional email, LinkedIn URL.
   - City and state only — no full street address.
   - Portfolio, GitHub, or personal website URL if relevant.

2. **Professional Summary**
   - 2–3 sentences highlighting years of experience, core expertise, and unique value.
   - Tailor this section to every role you apply for.
   - Include your most impressive quantified achievement here.

3. **Work Experience**
   - Reverse chronological order.
   - Company name, job title, dates (month/year), and location.
   - Use bullet points — not paragraphs — to describe accomplishments.
   - Quantify results wherever possible.

4. **Skills Section**
   - Technical skills relevant to the target position.
   - Separate hard skills from soft skills.
   - Include proficiency levels where appropriate (e.g. "Python — Advanced").

5. **Education**
   - Degree, institution, graduation date.
   - Relevant coursework, honours, or GPA only if above 3.5 or recent graduate.

6. **Optional Sections**
   - Certifications and licences.
   - Open-source contributions and personal projects.
   - Publications, patents, or conference talks.
   - Volunteer work (if relevant to the role).

## Writing Effective Bullet Points

### Action Verb Formula
Start every bullet with a strong action verb:
- Led, Architected, Delivered, Implemented, Optimised, Reduced, Increased, Launched, Designed, Automated, Migrated, Mentored, Negotiated, Orchestrated.

### Quantify Your Impact
- "Increased sales by 25% over 6 months through targeted email campaigns."
- "Managed a team of 8 developers delivering features for 1.2 M active users."
- "Reduced API response time by 40% through query optimisation and caching."
- "Implemented CI/CD pipeline reducing deployment time from 4 hours to 15 minutes."

### BAR Method (Background, Action, Result)
- **Background** — Brief context (one clause).
- **Action** — What you specifically did (the verb phrase).
- **Result** — Measurable outcome or business impact.

Example: "Facing a 30% spike in support tickets (Background), redesigned the onboarding flow with contextual tooltips and a progress tracker (Action), reducing first-week support requests by 45% (Result)."

## ATS Optimisation

### Applicant Tracking System Tips
- Use standard section headings: "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills".
- Include relevant keywords directly from the job description.
- Use standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Garamond, or Times New Roman.
- Avoid graphics, tables, multi-column layouts, and text boxes.
- Save as both PDF and Word document (some ATS systems prefer .docx).
- Don't put critical information in headers or footers — many parsers skip them.

### Keyword Strategy
- Mirror language from the job posting verbatim.
- Include both acronyms and full forms (e.g. "Artificial Intelligence (AI)").
- Use industry-standard terminology rather than company-internal jargon.
- Mention certifications and technologies by their official names.
- Repeat the most critical keywords 2–3 times naturally across different sections.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Typos and grammar errors** — Proofread multiple times. Use tools like Grammarly. Have a friend review it.
2. **Generic, un-tailored resumes** — Customise your summary and skills section for every application.
3. **Duties instead of achievements** — "Responsible for managing the database" is weak. "Migrated 12 TB PostgreSQL cluster to Aurora with zero downtime" is strong.
4. **Too long** — Keep to 1 page for < 10 years of experience, 2 pages maximum otherwise.
5. **Irrelevant information** — Remove jobs older than 10–15 years. Drop outdated technologies.
6. **Missing keywords** — If the posting says "React", your resume should say "React", not just "JavaScript frameworks".

## Industry-Specific Tips

### Technology Roles
- List programming languages, frameworks, and cloud platforms prominently.
- Include links to GitHub, portfolio projects, or technical blog.

### Management and Leadership Roles
- Emphasise team size, budget responsibility, and cross-functional collaboration.
- Include strategic initiatives and their business outcomes.

### Sales, Marketing, and Business Roles
- Lead with revenue, quota attainment, and pipeline numbers.
- Include customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV) improvements.
- Highlight campaign ROI with specific percentages.
- Mention CRM platforms and marketing automation tools by name.
