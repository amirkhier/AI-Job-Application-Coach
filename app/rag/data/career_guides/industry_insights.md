- Simple scripting and one-off automation tasks.

### Company Size Considerations

| Factor | Startup (1-50) | Mid-size (50-1000) | Large (1000+) |
|--------|----------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Equity** | High upside, high risk | Moderate | Lower upside, more liquid |
| **Salary** | Often below market | Competitive | At or above market |
| **Scope** | Broad — wear many hats | Moderate specialisation | Deep specialisation |
| **Growth** | Rapid if company succeeds | Structured paths available | Clear ladders, slower pace |
| **Stability** | Low — runway-dependent | Moderate | High |
| **Bureaucracy** | Minimal | Some process | Significant |

## Career Development Strategies

### Building a Future-Proof Career
1. **Invest in fundamentals** — Data structures, system design, and communication skills never go out of style.
2. **Learn adjacent domains** — An engineer who understands product thinking, or a PM who can read code, is far more valuable.
3. **Build in public** — Blog posts, open-source contributions, and conference talks compound your reputation over time.
4. **Maintain a learning budget** — Dedicate 5–10 hours per month to courses, books, or side projects.
5. **Cultivate your network** — Most senior roles are filled through referrals, not job boards.

### Career Transition Strategies

**From Other Industries to Tech:**
- Identify and articulate your transferable skills (analysis, communication, domain expertise).
- Complete a focused bootcamp or structured online course (not just tutorials).
- Build 2–3 portfolio projects that solve real problems.
- Contribute to open-source to build credibility and learn real-world codebases.
- Network within tech communities — attend meetups, join Discord/Slack groups.

**Moving Up Within Tech:**
- Seek stretch assignments that expose you to the next level's expectations.
- Find a mentor or sponsor who is 1–2 levels above you.
- Document your impact rigorously — you'll need it for promotion packets.
- Develop leadership skills early: code review, mentoring, design docs.
- Consider lateral moves to gain breadth before pursuing management.
