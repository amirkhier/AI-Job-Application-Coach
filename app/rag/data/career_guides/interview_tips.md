# Interview Tips and Best Practices

## Before the Interview

### Research the Company
- Study the company's mission, values, and recent news.
- Understand their products, services, and target market.
- Research the interviewer's background on LinkedIn.
- Prepare thoughtful questions about the role and company culture.
- Review the company's Glassdoor, Blind, or Fishbowl reviews for culture signals.

### Prepare Your Stories
Use the **STAR method** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for behavioral questions:
- **Situation** — Set the context: where, when, and what project.
- **Task** — Explain your specific responsibility or goal.
- **Action** — Describe *your* actions in detail (not the team's).
- **Result** — Quantify the outcome and state what you learned.

Prepare at least 5–7 STAR stories that cover these themes:
1. Overcoming a tight deadline or major obstacle.
2. Working with a difficult team member or stakeholder.
3. Learning something new under pressure.
4. Making a mistake and recovering from it.
5. Leading a project or initiative.
6. Handling ambiguity or incomplete requirements.
7. Delivering measurable business impact.

### Common Behavioral Questions
1. Tell me about a time you faced a challenging deadline.
2. Describe a situation where you had to work with a difficult team member.
3. Give an example of when you had to learn something new quickly.
4. Tell me about a time you made a mistake and how you handled it.
5. Describe your greatest professional achievement.
6. Tell me about a time you had to influence someone without authority.
7. Give an example of a time you went above and beyond expectations.

## During the Interview

### Body Language and Communication
- Maintain natural eye contact and confident posture.
- Listen actively — pause before answering to show you are thinking.
- Speak clearly and at a measured pace; avoid filler words.
- Show genuine enthusiasm for the role and company.
- Mirror the interviewer's energy level appropriately.

### Technical Interview Tips
- **Think out loud** — show your reasoning process, not just the answer.
- Ask clarifying questions before diving into a solution.
- Consider edge cases and discuss trade-offs explicitly.
- If you don't know something, say so honestly and explain how you would find the answer.
- For system design questions, start with requirements and constraints before architecture.
- Write clean, readable code during live coding. Variable names matter.

### Questions to Ask Interviewers
- What does success look like in this role in the first 90 days?
- What are the biggest challenges facing the team right now?
- How does this position contribute to the company's strategic goals?
- What opportunities exist for professional development and growth?
- What do you personally enjoy most about working here?
- How is performance evaluated and how often?
- What is the team's approach to work-life balance?

## After the Interview

### Follow-up Best Practices
- Send a personalised thank-you email within 24 hours.
- Reiterate specific points from the conversation that excited you.
- Address any concerns that came up during the interview.
- Provide any additional information or references requested.
- If you haven't heard back within the stated timeframe, send a polite follow-up.

### Self-Assessment
After every interview, write down:
1. Questions you answered well.
2. Questions where you stumbled.
3. Anything you wish you had said differently.
4. Questions they asked that you want to practise more.

This reflection loop is the fastest way to improve between interviews.
